## WEEK-TWO

### What did you do this past week?

I finished the project Collatz earlier this week, and spent the entire weekend hacking the mini-shell project. It always takes me forever to understand what is going on behind those signal commands, and writing a shell upon that definitely puts a lot of pressure. Other than that, I attended the engineering expo and failed an online assessment test. That's my week.

### What's in your way?

Project Voting just released when I began writing this blog, so I will take some time looking into that. Since we already have the experience on github/travis tools, I'm expecting a more challenging problem to work on. Meanwhile, I need to take a good rest and prepare for the upcoming phone interview next week.

### What will you do next week?
 
Like I said, the most important event on my calendar of next week is the phone screening. This is a solid company I want to work for, so I got super nervous. Isn't it strange that I am always worrying too much? Before receiving the email from hiring manager, I'm kind of afraid that I won't get any response so it was hard to calm down and concentrate; yet after that, I became thrilled for a while and then began to feel nervous and regret not spending a bit more time preparing in advance. 

### What's my experience of the class?

We did a couple of hackerrank practice, which is a lot of fun. I'm so glad that in this class we can pay attention to those subtle things like difference between pre/post increment and the usage of &/. Instead of getting in touch with some fancy libraries or powerful tools, I believe examining the very detail of a language is quite necessary before we land on a career.   

### What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

NoSQL. I used to have an impression that most databases require SQL commands, and the so called NO-SQL database does not make much sense to me. However, I somehow ran into the term MongoDB this week so I decided to take a look at NoSQL. Basically NoSQL is a collection of non-relational databases, and some operations may be faster than the tranditional way when we need to process massive data. One common example is the key-value database, and one simple advantage is that we don't have to design the logic between tables.

## WEEK-TWO

### What did you do this past week?

I started project Collatz and went pretty well. I got AC on the Hackerrank which took me an entire night. Piazza is super helpful! I think people started earlier put out some excellent questions I also ran into. Other than this CS371P, the mini-shell project for 439 takes a lot of time and I'm still trying to finish the signal part; For 345, the functional programming in Haskhell is challenging as well. Anyway this is a busy week, and probably it is going to be worse later this semester when exams came in.  

### What's in your way?

Finishing all current projects. This semester for me is particularly fast-pacing, and projects just came one after another. Besides the CS courses, I didn't realize that world literature class could also be time-consuming and I definitely need to catch up with the reading. At least the good side is that I really enjoy programming and figuring out problems, so the workload is high yet not that overwhelming. 

### What will you do next week?

I got an online assessment appointment next week, and I will also be attending the engineering career fair. It's the beginning of the spring semester and I'm still looking for a summer internship offer. After tons of rejections, it is hard to keep up the confidence. Am I worried too much about it? Possibly.  

### What's my experience of the class?

The class is awesome. Again, I think I made the wise choice because the material is practical and easy to follow. In the lectures we talked about the workflow for project Colltaz, some unit tests and coverage etc. Projects usually come in more diffcult than the lectures since we need to demonstrate our understanding, and sometimes we just have no idea what to start with. 

### What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

Travis CI. At first I was confusing and tried to run g++ and everything, until I realized that travis already did that for us. However, I have no idea why Travis has to install all the libraries and tools repeatly on every build, which results in an unreasonable time to wait for the results. In general, Travis CI automates the process of deploying and testing software projects, and I would absolutely consider using this platform for massive projects in the future.

## WEEK-ONE

### What are your expectations of the class? 

Walking into the junior year, I find myself eager to take as much CS courses as possible. I know I'm struggling with *POINTERS*, so diving into C/C++ seems to be the challenge that I need to overcome. People say you have to take at least one course by Professor Downing before getting a CS degree â€” here it goes. I also expect to learn some practical skills to prepare for the upcoming interviews, and signing up for this course definitely helps.

### What did you do this past week?

I stayed warm at home and watched out for the freezing weather. Just kidding! I attended several lectures to grasp what's going on, finalized the schedule for this semester and planned my degree progress. That's pretty much the same as everyone else.  

### What's in your way?

A lot of pressure. Other than this course, I'm taking CS439 and CS345 as well. (BTW Why so many posts mentioned 439?) I'm not insane; I just love going against general advice to see what sort of journey it would be. For me, being busy is the only way to avoid slacking off. I don't like implementing operating system at all, but I think topics like using Haskell to write a interpreter for JavaScript and taking LIVE programming test as exams should be so exciting!

### What will you do next week?

I will be working on the very first project in 439, since I just can't wait to see how horrible it could be. Also, I will get in touch with more classmates to suffer this semester together. Hopefully I will still have time to catch up with other courses and having fun a little bit. Anyway, I'm so ready to get along with these time-consuming courses.

### What's my experience of the class?

Fantastic. Professor Downing mentioned the word "interview" a lot in class, and every time it thrills me to switch on the work mode. Class notes are also available on github, so that we can always keep track of any materials in case it comes up. The lecture was fairly easy to follow. We went over Docker briefly, a little bit c++ basics and the usage of assertions. I used to make tests using assertion, and I was not able to judge other cases if the assertion stuck at one place. This is one of the very few experiences that I found the lecture could be so practical and close to real-life programming experience instead of theories, so I liked it a lot.  

### What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

I will give it to Docker. I remember once I was asked whether I have any experience of Docker in a phone interview, and that really freaks me out. I don't really know much about it, even though I ran into the term Docker a lot when googling stuff. Unfortunately I got rejected in that interview, and I wish I had taken this course.
