## WEEK-TEN

### What did you do this past week?

Finished two tough exams, one design interview and another design milestone. It's a quite busy week for me and I hardly have time to work on the Darwin project. The virtual memory project for OS is devastating! The reference solution is like 1500+ lines in total. My group is totally lost in the Pintos paging mechanism, and we just keep trying and trying to see if we get more understanding each time. 

### What's in your way?

I'm still having one exam coming up and two projects due next week, which sounds like a long way to go. Well, such tight schedule should be back to normal starting mid-April. Finals are actually fine since some classes would put it off until mid-May when we don't have other classes to worry about; except for the day of May 3, in which I will be taking two exams. Am I thinking of days too far away?

### What will you do next week?

First off I need to finish the projects, including the Darwin one. This OOP project should be fairly straghtforward to work with, but considering the freedom to design UML and probably many edge cases, I might need to allocate a little bit more time for that. Then it is the second OS exam; please be gentle on this one! 

### What's my experience of the class?

At this point I feel like we are combing all those materials we went over before. The */& operator showed up a lot more, and everything on HackerRank is class/struct-based. We need to write those operators still. And what about that overwhelming syntax && ? I promise I will spend more time practicing HackerRank tests as soon as I am done with the upcoming exam and the VM project.

### What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

Since this is project-related, I read the article about "Getters and Setters". I can still reflect back to the time when I was taking intro CS classes; we wrote Java and these Getters and Setters were very much like a commonplace I saw every time. I never pay attention to the plausibility for that or notice this being not really object oriented. Reading this article definitely helps me understand the data abstraction and some fundamental precepts, and I hope I can apply some of them as I progress along the Darwin project. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


## WEEK-NINE

### What did you do this past week?

Finally finished the userprog project for 439 before the deadline! However, the next virtual memory one seems really overwhelming. It's the first week back from the spring break, so definitely a lot of catch up to do. I also took the exam for programming languages and it turns out fine. The course material was obscure, yet the test itself was fairly easy and straghtforward.

### What's in your way?

I'm so ready to fight for the last six weeks of this semester. How time flies! I still have a decent chance to get a higher grade to boost up my average a little bit, so I guess I will work hard towards it to make my GPA looks better before I finalize my resume for the full time job hunting this fall.  

### What will you do next week?

Two exams coming up: government and literature. To be honest, I don't have too much interest taking these non-stem courses; nevertheless, time to get serious now. My overlook to these courses have hindered me in my overall GPA, and I should not let it happen again. Meanwhile, I will need to take a design interview w/ another design milestone due next week. Simply impossible to catch a break.

### What's my experience of the class?

The hackerRank test is getting significantly more challenging. Even though I did well on the midterm exam, I'm expecting the final to be much tougher.

### What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

It is irrelevant to most of y'all, but as a english as a second language person like me find it painful to do anything in my mother language in Linux/Unix like environment. I spent a little time today installing Fcitx, which is an input method framework, to seamlessly patch a small language feature in my Ubuntu system. For starters, I need to purge the previous problematic input method; then maybe remove the dependencies, install this framework, check the default configurations and restart my session to get it to work. If any of the steps is missing, then extra effort will possibly be needed. What if I need access to some resource in another language while using the lab machines? What if I'm not a cs student and encounter a bug on the steps above? I just hope life can be easier for those not so familiar with computers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



## WEEK-EIGHT

### What did you do this past week?

I almost forgot the blog post this week! It's the week right before spring break so what I did is clearing up everything on my schedule so that I don't have to worry about anything when I'm out of the town. Specifically, I finished the project for programming languages, a few assignments for non-cs classes and settled a plan for our group's os project. The weekend was awesome! I finally got a chance to hang out in my friend's place. Then I headed out to Fredericksburg and enchanted rock etc.

### What's in your way?

This spring break is like 10 days in total... and half way through it I feel pretty satisfied already. Then I checked the piazza as I would normally do and realize that I missed this weekly blog. That's how I got here writing these words.

### What will you do next week?

Work on project allocator and try to wrap up the project user program asap. I think I have some ideas how to begin and proceed in this allocator project, so I'm not too worried about it; however, the 439 project has no progress bar at all: it is just impossible to estimate how much time it would take to fix the issues and pass the remaining tests without breaking the other ones. Plus, the user program project is essential for the later virtual memory & file systems, so I guess we have to figure out everything sooner than later.

### What's my experience of the class?

We were talking about this Allocator project for the entire week. This is indeed a confusing one in the first place as I did not see what is going on only by browsing the description on HackerRank. The lecture is definitely helpful and we even went through every provided files to have a clear look. Most of the work this time will be in the header file, which is really interesting in my eyes since we are finally working on a project that is so object-oriented. The casting part is pure magic and I'm expecting some related questions in the final HackerRank exam.

### What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

GitKraken. Basically GitKraken is a Git client with graphic interface, and I highly recommend it for solving merging conflicts. Usually when I have some merge conflicts I will simply check into files and fix the issue manually; however, this process can be annoying especially when there are multiple changes and those codes were even written by different people. GitKraken provides a very clean comparison between the two files, which is very intuitive to edit and save changes. Actually other than that, GitKraken is generally a nice GUI interacting with Git. You can even modify the workflow by draging the commits etc... very elegant and efficient. If you are working on a project that uses git a lot, a GUI client like GitKraken would be a good help.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




## WEEK-SEVEN

### What did you do this past week?

Other than the exam, I finally made the dicision on the internship this summer. Normally I am that kind of person who catches every opportunity to travel around, but this time I feel really tired and choose to stay in Austin for the summer. The exam was fine; I messed up the difference between random access/bidirection thing, but at least I got over the digit iterator questions. I assume "no code" on notes and did not realize that we are allowed to put some interfaces on it, as a result it took me quite a while to recall many details. Luckily the exam time was ample so that we can keep trying to fix all compilation errors.     

### What's in your way?

I have several projects due after the spring break, and I hope to work on them as early as possible in exchange for an entire awesome spring break. Nevertheless, the OS project, particularly, is crashing me and I am very doubtful on whether I am able to finish it ahead of due time. Sadly I may have to free up a large portion of the spring break to work on it.

### What will you do next week?

same as above.

### What's my experience of the class?

The review session before exam was very helpful, and the exam itself is very fair in my eyes. We have covered all the materials in lectures, and it is in our best interest to study and apply the knowledge in the exam. Right after the exam I was talking to professor Downing regarding my hesitation on internship choice, and I really appreciate his genuine advice on how to make a wise decision. It's so great to get some insights from such a nice professor! I will definitely consider stopping by his office hour more often.

### What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

Guicorn. It might not be helpful unless you are working on deployment of python web project... Well so Gunicorn is a Python WSGI HTTP Server for UNIX and I like its simplicity and compatiblity. I used to be a uWSGI user (a similar application server); however, this time it does not really work well with my Django project. Very randomly my project would run into some weird bugs and uWSGI would restart agian, repeatly killing process and respawn. I was really frustrated and could not find out any problem with my code. I was left with no choice and passively trying with Guicorn. Funny enough, all bugs disappeared after setting up Guicorn. I assume I might did something wrong with uWSGI, but honestly the uWSGI document does not have much detailed information on the error I ran into. Upon now I choose to go with Guicorn as it does thankfully save me a lot of time on deployment! I don't even have a evidence to claim that Guicorn is better than uWSGI; but personally, No more uWSGI then:P  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


## WEEK-SIX

### What did you do this past week?

This has been quite a week for me, a mixture of exams and interviews. I did not expect to have so much interviews going on right after the career fair, and surprisingly, I finally hear back from an interview two weeks ago and got my first internship offer! Life is great. Meanwhile, I feel really exhausting pulling all-nighters for the exams. So glad I have this weekend to wrap up the mess and take a good rest.   

### What's in your way?

I am little behind in school work since I did not attend a few letures this week. I will definitely catch up earlier next week before some assignment dues. Also we are having the HackerRank exam this upcoming Thursday, so I guess that would take me some time to go over all the exercise we did in class and be comfortable writing c++.

### What will you do next week?

I will get back to a regular routine, pick up stuff from where I left and keep optimistic. Probably I will receive some rejections and hopefully some good news. Additionally, I need to get some medicine if my sore throat does not get better. It has been just too much work this past week and typically the inflamed throat indicates that my body is not in a good condition. Drink more water! Get more sleep!

### What's my experience of the class?

Ever since we got into the Iterator and operator thing, I was confused a bit. Looking at the code itself, I don't have trouble understanding the materials. However, when it comes to the HackerRank exercise, it was sometimes confusing how to get it right. Anyway what I need is just more practice to be familiar with everything before the test, and if I need more help we always have piazza and office hours so no worries.  

### What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

Doing research before going to a career fair is really important and effective. Last semester was my first time going to a career fair, and I had no idea what to expect or how to behave. When the recruiter asked something like what do I know about this company, I can not even come up with an adequate prepared answer. Learning from the mistakes, this time I check out all the companies I have interet in and carefully think of some questions that I may encounter. This helps a lot in my confidence, and as a result I am getting more interviews out of it, so I would strongly recommend doing more preparations on your target companies before such events.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



## WEEK-FIVE

### What did you do this past week?

At this point in the semester, every weekend blog tends to be identical. What did I do? I can't even recall. Endless projects, homeworks and assignments. CS439 takes up a large portion of my life, and what's even worse, we are having an incoming exam and project due later next week. In comparison, the Voting project was much easier to work through. Back to the topic, I think the most exciting thing in this past week is the Chinese Spring Festival, which is as important as Chrismas in US. Great to see my family and friends are having a good time and celebrating.

### What's in your way?

CNS career fair is coming. I assume no one would like to stand by line, smiling, bragging and repeating for an entire afternoon; but I guess this is just one of the neccessary steps we have to follow in order to land on an internship or a full-time job. It is overwhelming to see the pile of resumes getting ridiculously high: how could we possibly stand out in that giant resume box? The career fair is not like a personal interview where we can actually demonstarte our skills, but the fact that we don't often have the opportunity for an interview makes the career fair much more important.

### What will you do next week?

Same as above. Career fair, exams, project due, homework and assignments. 

### What's my experience of the class?

We were getting into the template/typename. As we practiced through HackerRank, I gradually realized that how challenging it could be to write an elegant and accurate program even if it only has a few lines. For example, I have never paid this much attention to any simple operator like '=='. It seems like a simple equal operator to me. However, considering factors like the lvalue/rvalue and data type, I have to admit that there is so much to learn.

### What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

Postman. It is a great API testing tool, basically a graphic version of curl or httpie. I launch it as a chrome app, findint it very handy and helpful. While the GET method can be easily tested through a url for RESTful APIs, a POST or PATCH method could contain a lot of information to handle with. Postman saves all the headers, body or even pre-request scripts and one of my favorite part is that Postman even saves all the test history we created for future reference. This saves a lot of typing and also as a chrome app it is fast and lightweight.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


## WEEK-FOUR

### What did you do this past week?

I had a good start in Voting project and pulled a all-nighter to finish the Haskell interpreter assignment for 345. Later this week I spent tons of hours figuring out the Thread lab for 439, and the bug in implementing the donation still upsets us a lot. Even though the project is dued ten days away, we already spent like 20 hours on it and still have no idea how much longer it is goint to take us.

### What's in your way?

The Voting project, which is dued in the coming Thursday. Honestly I started quite early and managed to pass the HackerRank test, but then I completely forgot about it. The code itself is still a mess and I will definitely rearrange that and probably add more comments. I am glad that I can keep up with three CS courses so far, and the days are really flying by. 

### What will you do next week?
  
I will keep working the Voting project and try to finish early, since I have a tough time working out the 439 Thread lab. Our group has decided to meet up basically everyday (sometimes every few hours!), which is insane. It is fun though, and it does not crash me since we have a large group of classmates suffering together while getting support from TAs all the time. 

### What's my experience of the class?

We went over the l/r value and const this week. Also we did a bit review on the distinction usage of \& and \*, a great memory refresh in just the right time. However I have to point out that challenging quiz: the problem itself is not difficult at all, however, the question is sort of like a word game and I did not get it at all in the first place, especially the "weakest form" part.

### What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

GNU Screen. Screen is a full-screen window manager that multiplexes interactive shells between several processes. I don't really like to stay up late in GDC lab, so I really need a handy tool to boost my ssh experience. Screen is really easy to use; whenever I need some functionality, I can always google the command in a second. In most cases, we just press ctrl+A, followed by a single character to do the switching, detaching, etc. My favorate part is that, most of the time we don't even realize that Screen exists when using it.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## WEEK-THREE

### What did you do this past week?

I finished the project Collatz earlier this week, and spent the entire weekend hacking the mini-shell project. It always takes me forever to understand what is going on behind those signal commands, and writing a shell upon that definitely puts a lot of pressure. Other than that, I attended the engineering expo and failed an online assessment test. That's my week.

### What's in your way?

Project Voting just released when I began writing this blog, so I will take some time looking into that. Since we already have the experience on github/travis tools, I'm expecting a more challenging problem to work on. Meanwhile, I need to take a good rest and prepare for the upcoming phone interview next week.

### What will you do next week?
 
Like I said, the most important event on my calendar of next week is the phone screening. This is a solid company I want to work for, so I got super nervous. Isn't it strange that I am always worrying too much? Before receiving the email from hiring manager, I'm kind of afraid that I won't get any response so it was hard to calm down and concentrate; yet after that, I became thrilled for a while and then began to feel nervous and regret not spending a bit more time preparing in advance. 

### What's my experience of the class?

We did a couple of hackerrank practice, which is a lot of fun. I'm so glad that in this class we can pay attention to those subtle things like difference between pre/post increment and the usage of &/. Instead of getting in touch with some fancy libraries or powerful tools, I believe examining the very detail of a language is quite necessary before we land on a career.   

### What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

NoSQL. I used to have an impression that most databases require SQL commands, and the so called NO-SQL database does not make much sense to me. However, I somehow ran into the term MongoDB this week so I decided to take a look at NoSQL. Basically NoSQL is a collection of non-relational databases, and some operations may be faster than the tranditional way when we need to process massive data. One common example is the key-value database, and one simple advantage is that we don't have to design the logic between tables. 



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




## WEEK-TWO

### What did you do this past week?

I started project Collatz and went pretty well. I got AC on the Hackerrank which took me an entire night. Piazza is super helpful! I think people started earlier put out some excellent questions I also ran into. Other than this CS371P, the mini-shell project for 439 takes a lot of time and I'm still trying to finish the signal part; For 345, the functional programming in Haskhell is challenging as well. Anyway this is a busy week, and probably it is going to be worse later this semester when exams came in.  

### What's in your way?

Finishing all current projects. This semester for me is particularly fast-pacing, and projects just came one after another. Besides the CS courses, I didn't realize that world literature class could also be time-consuming and I definitely need to catch up with the reading. At least the good side is that I really enjoy programming and figuring out problems, so the workload is high yet not that overwhelming. 

### What will you do next week?

I got an online assessment appointment next week, and I will also be attending the engineering career fair. It's the beginning of the spring semester and I'm still looking for a summer internship offer. After tons of rejections, it is hard to keep up the confidence. Am I worried too much about it? Possibly.  

### What's my experience of the class?

The class is awesome. Again, I think I made the wise choice because the material is practical and easy to follow. In the lectures we talked about the workflow for project Colltaz, some unit tests and coverage etc. Projects usually come in more diffcult than the lectures since we need to demonstrate our understanding, and sometimes we just have no idea what to start with. 

### What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

Travis CI. At first I was confusing and tried to run g++ and everything, until I realized that travis already did that for us. However, I have no idea why Travis has to install all the libraries and tools repeatly on every build, which results in an unreasonable time to wait for the results. In general, Travis CI automates the process of deploying and testing software projects, and I would absolutely consider using this platform for massive projects in the future.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## WEEK-ONE

### What are your expectations of the class? 

Walking into the junior year, I find myself eager to take as much CS courses as possible. I know I'm struggling with *POINTERS*, so diving into C/C++ seems to be the challenge that I need to overcome. People say you have to take at least one course by Professor Downing before getting a CS degree — here it goes. I also expect to learn some practical skills to prepare for the upcoming interviews, and signing up for this course definitely helps.

### What did you do this past week?

I stayed warm at home and watched out for the freezing weather. Just kidding! I attended several lectures to grasp what's going on, finalized the schedule for this semester and planned my degree progress. That's pretty much the same as everyone else.  

### What's in your way?

A lot of pressure. Other than this course, I'm taking CS439 and CS345 as well. (BTW Why so many posts mentioned 439?) I'm not insane; I just love going against general advice to see what sort of journey it would be. For me, being busy is the only way to avoid slacking off. I don't like implementing operating system at all, but I think topics like using Haskell to write a interpreter for JavaScript and taking LIVE programming test as exams should be so exciting!

### What will you do next week?

I will be working on the very first project in 439, since I just can't wait to see how horrible it could be. Also, I will get in touch with more classmates to suffer this semester together. Hopefully I will still have time to catch up with other courses and having fun a little bit. Anyway, I'm so ready to get along with these time-consuming courses.

### What's my experience of the class?

Fantastic. Professor Downing mentioned the word "interview" a lot in class, and every time it thrills me to switch on the work mode. Class notes are also available on github, so that we can always keep track of any materials in case it comes up. The lecture was fairly easy to follow. We went over Docker briefly, a little bit c++ basics and the usage of assertions. I used to make tests using assertion, and I was not able to judge other cases if the assertion stuck at one place. This is one of the very few experiences that I found the lecture could be so practical and close to real-life programming experience instead of theories, so I liked it a lot.  

### What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

I will give it to Docker. I remember once I was asked whether I have any experience of Docker in a phone interview, and that really freaks me out. I don't really know much about it, even though I ran into the term Docker a lot when googling stuff. Unfortunately I got rejected in that interview, and I wish I had taken this course.
